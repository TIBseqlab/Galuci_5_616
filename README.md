Libraries for single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing was constructed with an insert size of 10 kb using the SMRT bell TM Template kit (version 1.0). Then another round of sequencing was performed using PacBio Sequel platform. To perform genome assembly, SMRT Link v5.0.1 was used with optimized parameters. Illumina reads were used afterwards for reducing degree of heterozygosity using Purge Haplotigs software. Then RagTag software was used for reference-guided scaffolding. Finally, Illumina reads were used again for error correction using Pilon software.
